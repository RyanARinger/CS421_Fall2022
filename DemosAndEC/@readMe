CS421 Extra Credit Programs and Demos
--------------------------------------

1) You can run the .out for each conversion to learn how
   conversions work.  Also, reading the ALGORITHM comment
   in each .cpp file will help you learn.

2) You can write extra credit programs for these -
   each is a step in transforming a regular expression
   into a DFA.

   Read the EC assignment sheet first. 
   Review the corresponding notes first.
   
   Read @instructions very carefully!!!!

   Must use my template files when they are given.
   Must work with my input files.
   Must produce the same output files as mine.

   Do not submit unless it works perfectly! No partial credit.
