3. Finally, convert NFA to DFA
----------------------------------

Must use and complete nfadfaEC.cpp

In the nfa.txt file, we must put the highest state number first.
Then on the subsequent lines, put the Trs of the NFA:
state char state state .... -1

The output goes to dfa.txt

nfadfa.out demonstrates how your program should work.
