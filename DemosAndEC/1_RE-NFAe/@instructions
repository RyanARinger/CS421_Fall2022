1. Converts RE to NFA-e interactively via a menu
---------------------------------------------------

Must use and complete the re-nfaeEC.cpp file.   

In re.txt, we must type all the arrow labels we plan to use, one per line. 
e.g.
a
b
c
Component machines are created for these.

Then, step by step, machines are combined by the user.

At the end, nfa-e.txt will be the output showing the combined machines.

Limitation:  It does not allow you to do (a | a)   
 
re-nfae.out demonstrates how your program should work.

It would be nice if you could display the combined machines in a more
readable format because my output is hard to read.
