2. Convert NFA-e to NFA (removes all epsilon moves)
---------------------------------------------------

Must use and complete nfaeRemoveEC.cpp 

In the nfa-e.txt file, we must put the highest state number first.

Then, on the subsequent lines, put Trs of the NFA-e:
state char state state .... -1
where e stands for epsilon 
e.g. 1 e 2 3 -1 
     means from state 1 on epsilon, goes to state 2 and 3 
     -1 means end of the line

Output is nfa.txt containing NFA moves.

nfaRemove.out demonstrates how your program should work.
