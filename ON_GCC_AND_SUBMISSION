--------------------------------------
For project executable submission, do the following one file at a time:
Make sure the executable (.out) was created on Empress. Otherwise, I will
not be able to run it.

/cs/submitIt_LK  G#   filename

e.g.
/cs/submitIt_LK  G3   group3scanner.out
/cs/submitIt_LK  G3   scannerWork.txt

To get feedback on your project parts,

/cs/checkIt_LK  G#
